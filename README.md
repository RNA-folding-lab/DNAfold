# DNAfold
This simulation code was developed to predicting 3D structure and stability for double/single-stranded DNAs in ion solutions based on the coarse-grained (CG) model developed by Ya-Zhou Shi, Zi-Chun Mu, etc. This CG model was extended from the RNA CG model introduced by Ya-Zhou Shi, Lei Jin, Chen-Jie Feng, Xunxun Wang, Ya-Lan Tan and Zhi-Jie Tan at Tan's group, to predict 3D structure, stability and salt effect for RNAs from their sequences.
# Usage under Linux
1. Keep the following files (DNA.c, initial_cof.dat, and P.dat (option)) in the same directory;
3. Compile: gcc -Wall DNA.c -o DNA -lm
4. Run: ./DNA, and typing from the keyboard according to the hit;
     or ./DNA <P.dat, Ensuring that the P.dat is under the directory and modifying the file based on its description (see below). 
# Descriptions of input and output files
a. Input files
1. initial_conf.dat: initial conformation as input;
2. P.dat: parameters for the simulation
     (1). Folding Anealing or at constant T? 1. Folding (annealing) 2. Folding (constant temperature)
        --> 1 (using the SA algorithm for structure)   ***highly Recommend***
        --> 2 (using constant temperature for structure)
     (2). The number of chain:
        --> 2 (for dsDNA)
     (3). Input the 1-th chain length (nt):
        --> *** (Input the first chain length, e.g.11)
     (4). Input the 1-th chain sequence:
	      --> *********** (Input the first chain sequence, e.g.CGGACAAGAAG, capital letters of ATCG)
     (5). Input the 2-th chain length (nt):
   	    --> *** (Input the second chain length, e.g.11)
     (6). Input the 2-th chain sequence:
	      --> *********** (Input the first chain sequence, e.g.CTTCTTGTCCG, capital letters)
     (7). Including salt? yes or no 0. no 1. yes
	      --> 0 or 1
	   (8). if salt=0, input t0 (no salt)
  	 	  --> ** (Initial temperature (â„ƒ)), 
          if salt=1, input CNa CMg t0 (with salt)
  	   	--> ** ** ** ([Na+] (mM), [Mg2+] (mM), Initial temperature)
     (9). Input the chain concentration (mM)
	      --> *** (chain concentration)
(b) Output files
1. conf.dat: predicted conformations at different MC steps;
2. BP.dat: predicted base pairs at different MC steps;
3. U.dat: energy of predicted conformations at different MC steps;
4. jg.dat: radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, and persistent length of predicted conformations at different MC steps;
5. para.dat: some information for this running, including start time, output frequency, etc.
